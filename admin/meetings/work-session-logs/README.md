# Coworking Log Template
> [!NOTE]
> **How to use**
> Make a copy of this file in this same folder
> Every time you make a log, title it **MM-DD-YY-\[topic\]sprintlog.md**, where *topic* is just the kind of work being done.
- if you met up to work on developing a feature, put `dev` in the `topic` spot
- if you met up to work on devops/ setting up unit tests, put `devops`
> Just make the title informative!  

In the course of our project, small subsets of the team will often be meeting up separately when schedules align. Any time any part of the team meets up to do work, we should be logging the work we do so everyone stays on the same page!  
## Date
## Attendees
## Purpose of Meeting
Write a short description over goals for the work session. i.e. implement features xx (link the issue) or test and demo xx
## Progress
What was done? If you were working on issues, link the issue and the name of the person assigned to each  
## Questions or Blockers?
If there are any needs for the team to address, enter them here and then ask them in Slack!  

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Once you're done filling this out, commit and push it to github, and then message the slack channel letting us know that you've met and posted an update in the Github!
