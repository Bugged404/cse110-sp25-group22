# Coworking Log Template

> [!NOTE] > **How to use**
> Make a copy of the md for the type of meeting that happened, fill in the notes, and then move it into the right foler.
> Every time you make a log, title it **MM-DD-YY-sprinttype-sprintnumber.md**, where `sprinttype` is planning, review, or retro.

- if it's a retro of the prior sprint, the sprint number should be one less than the current week's sprint
  > Just make the title informative!

In the course of our project, small subsets of the team will often be meeting up separately when schedules align. Any time any part of the team meets up to do work, we should be logging the work we do so everyone stays on the same page!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once you're done filling meeting minutes out, commit and push it to github, and then message the slack channel letting us know that you've met and posted an update in the Github!
