   - Expectations 
      1. Follow coding standards set by team, get code reviewed
      2. Read communications from teammates thoroughly and respond to them in a timely manner (48 hours)
         - check slack at least every other day
         - interact in the slack: react to messages!
      3. Communicate honestly
         - if you got stuck or didn't get work done, say so, and give a plan for when you'll have it done by or ask for help
         - share blockers: it's important for the team to know the truth! No one's going to get mad at you
      4. Support team participation
         - Raising your hand in class: if one person raises their hand, we all do to support
         - Group trips to office hours
