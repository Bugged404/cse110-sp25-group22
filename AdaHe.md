### About Me
I'm a 3rd year student from the San Jose, studying Cognitive Science (on the Machine Learning track) and minoring in Computer Science! I'm a UX designer for UC San Diego Library's web team, and I have some preliminary experience working with frontend frameworks (so terrible, I know). My hobbies are yoga, cooking, singing, and reading!
