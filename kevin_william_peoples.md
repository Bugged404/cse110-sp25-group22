A little about me:

- I love building full-stack apps, especially ones that involve AI and automation.
- I'm big into the gym â€” lifting, calisthenics, and pushing limits every week.
- I love cooking steaks â€” medium rare with a good sear is the way to go.
- Casual gamer into strategy games and anything with a solid storyline.
- I function on code and caffeine.

Looking forward to working with all of you this quarter
