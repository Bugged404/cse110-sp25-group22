# Hey I'm Alex Tatoian :smile:
## About Me
I am a 3rd year transfer student from [Pasadena City College (PCC)](pasadena.edu) majoring in Computer Science. Away from academics, I play for the UCSD ice hockey team, which I am assuming no one even knew about! I also like to play the piano on my free time, which hasn't been very often as of recently. I've never done really anything related to SWE, so this will be a learning curve for me. Please be patient :pray: :pray: :pray:  
Looking very forward to working with you guys this quarter!!!
