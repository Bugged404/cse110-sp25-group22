The miro boards and spreads we created during our brainstorming process are labeled and included here, for easier viewing.  
The `/card-idea-dump.png` file **is not included** in our [pitch document](https://github.com/CSE110-22-TrojanHorses/cse110-sp25-group22/blob/main/specs/pitch/Project%20Proposal_%20Greeting%20Cards.pdf), but it reflects our initial research process, where we threw out all the ideas for cards that we were interested in, did research on each type of card, and then narrowed down based on our gleanings.  
Tarot cards were the runner up option, but we ultimately ruled them out because of interpretation complexity.
